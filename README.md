# Harnessing Helpfulness: Amazon Product Reviews to Elevate Marketplace Experience

# Overview

Reviews have become an essential part of the online shopping experience. Reviews serve as the means for customers to make well-informed decisions on the quality of the product and services offered after the purchasing of the product. The E-commerce experience is evolving in the digital era, transforming how purchase decisions are made after validating the reviews. There is a shift in the perception and behaviors of customers. Recent research suggests that 77% of shoppers explicitly seek out websites with reviews and ratings. Our research aims to smoothen the decision-making process by evaluating customer insights and understanding what they find most helpful about products based on reviews. In this study, we are attempting to classify the reviews as being helpful or not based on their content, metadata, sentiment, and relevance to the product. This study has dual benefits - insights about review helpfulness can benefit both stakeholders in the marketplace, i.e., buyers/customers and sellers.

# Data Overview

The dataset we focused on is a subset of the “Amazon Review Data (2018)” published by  Ni (2018), UCSD. The dataset contains a total of 233.3 million reviews and different categories, and these reviews are in the range of May 1996 to Oct 2018. For our project, we will consider the data from 2010-2018 and only the objective categories, including appliances, automotive, cell phones and accessories, and tools and home improvement.

# Data Preprocessing



# Machine Learning
We propose the usage of multiple supervised machine-learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and Random Forest. The proposed model workflow diagram is shown in Figure 1 for our project, and we will also perform text processing using techniques like TFIDF, Stemming, Lemmatization, Stopford removal, etc., on the raw review text to generate features.
